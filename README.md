#### App Description

E-commerce store front built with the MERN stack. Uses the PayPal API to allow users to 'purchase' items from the store.

###### How MERNshop Works

- When a user arrives to the page, they see a carousel displaying the top three products from the store as well as the latest products loaded below.
- Users can shop around and add items to their cart.
- Once a user is ready to checkout, they must sign in or create an account.
- When a user is logged in they will be able to complete their purchase using PayPal.
- Logged in users can edit their profile and view their orders.
- Admin accounts also exist.
- Admins are able to add new products to the store, modify users/orders, and mark items as shipped.
